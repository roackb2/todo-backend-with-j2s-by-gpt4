# What's this?

This is a sample TODO API service using [j2s](https://www.npmjs.com/package/j2s/v/2.0.10) created by instructing GPT4 with small modifications.
Main modifications are the way to pass bookshelf instance into j2s config. Also the generated knexfile.js content is wrong. I copied one from the official documentation from knex.js.

## The prompt

Detail of the prompt please see `prompt.md`. It's a shorter version of the j2s README followed by the prompt to ask GPT to create the app.

## The response

The response of GPT4 is screenshot at the `gpt4-j2s-todo-backend.pdf` file. Take a look for the full conversation.
